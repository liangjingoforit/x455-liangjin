              Place Holder for Content - [Vegetables play an important role in human nutrition. Most are low
              in fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary
              fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and
              trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins
              A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is
              found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke,
              cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has
              shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three
              servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than
              five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of
              developing coronary heart disease or stroke.]

                  Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or

                  used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all

                  plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but
                  include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes,

                  Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or
                  other animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly
                  used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all
                  edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems,
                  leaves, roots, and seeds. An alternate definition of the term
